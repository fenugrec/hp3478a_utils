Extra files required to build a DOS .exe.
Only reason for this is to run ISA-GPIB hardware on old iron.

**GPIB driver
DECL.H, MCIB.LIB: from NI 2.7.2 driver for DOS; they provide a .LIB file in Microsof C format.

**getopt
easy to compile.
source used:

**djgpp :
There's apparently no way to convert MCIB.LIB to a format understood by djgpp-gcc,
partly due to memory model issues

** MSC
-compiling the whole thing with MS C (recommend >= 6)
-solves the NI driver lib issue.
-MSC6 nmake sucks
-lots of tweaks needed for 8.3 filenames and other garbage
-MSC looks for its own "SLIBCE.LIB" ? wtf. Give it slibc7.lib
