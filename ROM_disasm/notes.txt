This is my WIP annotated disassembly of ROM dump "03478-65501_dc118" available from ko4bb.

A few notes:

CPU : 8039 (MCS-48 family, compatible with 8048)
GPIB controller : 8291

pins :
P21 : !CS for GPIB
P22 : !CS to read DIP switch
P23 = !CE for cal SRAM
P26 : address bit12 ! (to run code > 0x1000)
P27 : data out thru isol
T1 : data in thru isol (read with jt1 / jnt1 opcodes)

Identified code :
-some BCD arithmetic
-GPIB code : around 0x1200-0x1400. I haven't worked out the state machine and detailed command parsing.
-CAL data writes + checksums
